## Space Shooter


## About
Space Shooter is an action game I built with Python and Pygame. You pilot a spaceship, shooting asteroids and battling a tough boss to earn points. I created this to dive into fast-paced mechanics, enemy spawning, and boss fight design.


## Features
1. Move your spaceship left/right with arrow keys and shoot bullets with the spacebar.
2. Three asteroid types (small, medium, large) with different speeds and health.
3. A boss appears after destroying 10 asteroids, with spiral bullet attacks and two phases.
4. Player has 3 HP; earn 10 points per asteroid and 100 for the boss.
5. Explosion effects for destroyed enemies and hit effects (red tint) for damage.
6. Start screen (press space) and game-over screen with score (restart with 'R').


## How to Play
1. Use left/right arrow keys to move the spaceship.
2. Press spacebar to shoot bullets at asteroids or the boss.
3. Dodge asteroids and boss bullets to keep your 3 HP.
4. Destroy 10 asteroids to trigger the boss fight.
5. If HP hits 0, game over! Press 'R' to restart.
